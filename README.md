# tamu_bus_routes_project
This is a project with the goal of generating an automatic GTFS file for the TAMU bus routes.

The api I'm translating from is located at [](http://transport.tamu.edu:80/BusRoutesFeed/swagger/docs/v1)

I'm using Google's transitfeed library for formatting the GTFS file, and deeply appreciating the requests library.
